### Who?

Hi, Iâ€™m Marius a Congolese Software Engineer and Writer living in Dakar, Senegal. 

I write about what I've learned in my day-to-day work, experiences, or something that interests me to improve my knowledge base. Daily I build products for my own needs or my employer and I like and enjoy it. I can work on the entire stack from the database design, to the frontend, and backend and take end-to-end ownership across all areas of the software development lifecycle, including: designing, building, releasing, and monitoring.

I enjoy watching manga and Formula 1, listening to good music, or running. ðŸ’¡
